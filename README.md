## Motivations

1. Currently the main method passengers are booking tickets is by using railway websites and there arenâ€™t many mobile apps for the same

2. Making a mobile app to make it accessible for booking tickets, checking status of trains to plan their trips

## Scope 

This system is reserved only for booking tickets, informations about the management of trains(kilometers and etc), drivers(how much is their salaries). In this system, the user can:
1. See available trips from one location to another;
2. See all trips the user made in a month;
3. Buy tickets;
4. The train system control, can track all information about the passengers as well as the payments.

The Database technology being used is MySQL 8. We used python FastAPI to build the backend(APIs)
