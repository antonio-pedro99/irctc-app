## Motivations

1. Currently the main method passengers are booking tickets is by using railway websites and there arenâ€™t many mobile apps for the same

2. Making a mobile app to make it accessible for booking tickets, checking status of trains to plan their trips

## Scope 

This system is reserved only for booking tickets, informations about the management of trains(kilometers and etc), drivers(how much is their salaries). In this system, the user can:
1. See available trips from one location to another;
2. See all trips the user made in a month;
3. Buy tickets;
4. The train system control, can track all information about the passengers as well as the payments.

## Backend
You will need an alive instance of our backend before running the APP.
You can find the Backend here [Backend](https://github.com/antonio-pedro99/irctc-backend)
Follow up all the steps needed to run the backend locally on your machine then come back to here.

## Running the APP

If you are willing to run the app on an emulator, then you should change the base
